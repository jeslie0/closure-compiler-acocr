#+title: Closure Compiler ACOCR
[[https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20for-Nix-7eb8e2.svg]]  [[https://img.shields.io/github/license/jeslie0/closure-compiler-acocr.svg]]

This is a nix flake wrapper around [[https://github.com/sd-yip/Google-Closure-Compiler-ACOCR][Google-Closure-Compiler-ACOCR]]. It takes care of the runtime dependencies and should "just work".

To use this, run ~closure-compiler-acocr~, with the normal arguments you pass to the [[https://github.com/google/closure-compiler][Google Closure Compiler]].

I use this to optimise PureScript code; see [[https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3713#issuecomment-999170951][this]] thread for more information.
